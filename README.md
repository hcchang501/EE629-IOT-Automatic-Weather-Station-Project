# EE629-IOT-Automatic-Weather-Station-Project
#In this project, I use Sense-Hat kit to collect the temperature, humidity, and pressure data adn send the data to google sheet for further analyze. The code is shwon in this repository. If you are trying to built your own Automatic Weather Station, you have to follow the instruction in IOT lesson 7 of Kevin Lu's repository. Make sure that you have your own Json file and put it into same folder to make it work.
